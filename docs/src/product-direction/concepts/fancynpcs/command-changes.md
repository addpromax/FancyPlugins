# Command Changes

!!!danger
This is the old documentation site for FancyInnovations, which is no longer maintained.
The new documentation site can be found at [fancyinnovations.com/docs/general](https://fancyinnovations.com/docs/general).
!!!


Some commands need to be refactored to be more consistent with the new system.

## turn_to_player and turn_to_player_distance

These commands should be merged into a single command with two subcommands.

- `/npc turn_to_player <npc> enabled (state)`
- `/npc turn_to_player <npc> distance (distance)`
