This is the old documentation site for FancyInnovations, which is no longer maintained.
The new documentation site can be found at [fancyinnovations.com/docs/hytale-plugins/fancycore](https://fancyinnovations.com/docs/hytale-plugins/fancycore).

FancyCore provides a set of built-in placeholders that can be used in various parts of the system.
You can use placeholders in almost any text field within FancyCore.
FancyCore also offers an API for creating and parse placeholders programmatically, read more about it in the [API documentation](../api/placeholders.md).
